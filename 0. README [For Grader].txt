Group4.ipynb is used to select the prediction for the test data. This notebook will import all the outputs from other notebooks and select the final answer.


Files named 6.X are used to generate predictions of the sales and will be exported to the folder named "Model_Prediction"
The models are trained using all train data in 'data-train.csv' and used to predict sales for the 'data-test.csv'


Files name from 2.X to 5.X, are for model selection, hyperparameter tuning and cross validation testing. 
Models will be narrowed down based on 2 performance indicators describe below 


1. Mean 10 fold mean squared error (MSE)


-Refer to 'CV_Comparison.ipynb' in the folder named 'Model_CV_Result_MSE' for the summary of the result

2. Mean 10 fold efficiency


-Refer to 'CV_Comparison.ipynb' in the folder named 'Model_CV_Result_Efficiency' for the summary of the result


Important Note: File 2.X to 5.X takes extremely long time to run.

Notebook to run:
-Everything else except 2.X to 5.X
