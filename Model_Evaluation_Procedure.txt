Data Preprocessing
1. Remove any NA data 
2. Combine train and test data (Some categorical values are not shared)
3. One-Hot-Encoding
4. Split into train and test data again
5. Log(Sales) - because of very large numbers
6. Normalise the predictors for PCA


Model Selection

1. In the pipeline, perform PCA then train Model
2. Use GridSearchCV to search for best hyperparameter
3. Use best parameter obtained from gridsearch to train a model
4. Split train data into train and test datasets, train the model and use test dataset to compare performance between models
5. Get the distribution of the residual (true_sales - model_prediction) and use QQ plot to explore the distribution. Get distribution parameter if nesessary
6. Inventory Decision: Decide on distribution by using K-Fold cross validation (Choose distribution with higher average profit)

Models to test/use
1. Gradient Boosting
2. Random Forest
