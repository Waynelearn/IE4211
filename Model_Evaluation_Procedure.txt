Data Preprocessing
1. Remove any NA data 
2. Combine train and test data (Some categorical values are not shared)
3. One-Hot-Encoding
4. Split into train and test data again
5. Log(Sales) - because of very large numbers
6. From the train data, allocate 20% as validation data set and 80% for training
 






Model Selection

1. Split given train data into train and test data again (80/20)
2. In the pipeline, perform Standard Scaler, then PCA then train Model
3. Use GridSearchCV to search for best hyperparameter
4. Use best parameter obtained from gridsearch to train a model
5. Use model to predict the test data and get error score by comparing to validation dataset
6. Get the distribution of the residual (true_sales - model_prediction) and use QQ plot to explore the distribution. Get distribution parameter if nesessary
7. Inventory Decision: Decide on distribution by using K-Fold cross validation (Choose distribution with higher average profit)

Models to test/use
1. Gradient Boosting
2. Random Forest
