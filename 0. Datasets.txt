There are 8 datasets present in this folder. 
(1 to 6) are derived from (7 & 8)

(1) A_Normalised_test_data.csv
-Categorical values are one-hot-encoded and all predictors are normalised for PCA.
Models that use PCA will use this to predict sales.

(2) A_Normalised_train_data.csv
-Categorical values are one-hot-encoded and all predictors are normalised for PCA.
Models that use PCA will use this to train model.

(3) A_sales_train.csv
-Original sales train data.

(4) A_Log_sales_train.csv
-Natural log of sales train data.
Used in models to compare performance between log(sales) and sales

(5) B_encoded_test_data.csv
-Categorical predictors are one-hot-encoded.
Used in Linear/Polynomial regression with no PCA to predict sales.

(6) B_encoded_train_data.csv
-Categorical predictors are one-hot-encoded.
Used in Linear/Polynomial regression with no PCA to train model.

(7) Data-test.csv
-Tree based model with no PCA will using this raw data to train model. No one-hot-encoding also.

(8) Data-train.csv
-Tree based model with no PCA will using this raw data to train model. No one-hot-encoding also.
